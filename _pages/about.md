# 🎊 Welcome to my website!

I am currently a PhD student majoring in Mechanical Engineering at the School of Engineering, Aalto University(Helsinki, Finland). I love to collaborate and work with different people on multi-disciplinary projects. And from extensive coursework, I have built up a solid background in embedded systems and dynamic modeling. ​

I received my Master's degree in Electronic Science and Technology from the Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech, China) in June 2024, under the supervision of [Prof. Yiming (Kevin) Rong](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/rongym/en/) and [Prof. Yongsheng Ma](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/mays/en/). During the years of my master's study, I was interested in Individual Product Customization, Customer-to-Manufacturer(C2M) Models, and Digital-twin.

I also received my bachelor’s degree at SUSTech in 2019, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. During this period, I worked on the fuel cell system design and control for drones in Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Hydrogen Energy with [Prof. Haijiang Wang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/wanghj/en/).

It took me over two years as a full-time staff member at SUSTech after I graduated in the summer of 2019. Fortunately, I returned to continue my M.Sc. study after finishing the job in August 2021, still at SUSTech, but a new beginning in my life.

Now, at Aalto University, new stories are coming. I'm exploring Machine Learning Tools to predict metallic materials' behavior under different loading cases in the Group of [Materials to Products](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-mechanical-engineering/materials-to-products).

Please have a look at my [CV](./docs/CV.pdf) here for more about my research projects and background. Please feel free to contact me for any questions or opportunities.
