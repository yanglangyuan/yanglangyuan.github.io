# 🎊 Welcome to my website!

I am currently an M.Sc. student majoring in Electronic Science and Technology at the Southern University of Science and Technology(SUSTech, China) under the supervision of [Prof. Yiming (Kevin) Rong](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/rongym/en/) and [Prof. Yongsheng Ma](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/mays/en/). I am a detail-oriented M.Sc. student interested in **Intelligent Manufacturing Systems**, **​Individual Product Customization**, **Customer-to-Manufacturer(C2M) Model**, **Cloud Computing**, and **Digital Twin**. I love to collaborate and work with different people on multi-disciplinary projects. And from extensive course work, I have built up a solid background in embedded systems and dynamic modeling. ​

I received my Bachelor’s degree from SUSTech, in 2019 with a major in Mechanical Engineering. During this period, I worked on the fuel cell system design and control for drones in Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Hydrogen Energy with [Prof. Haijiang Wang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/wanghj/en/).

It takes me more than 2 years as a full-time staff in SUSTech after I graduated in the Summer of 2019. Fortunately, I returned back to continue my M.Sc. study after finishing the job in August of 2021, still at SUSTech but a new beginning in my life.

Please find my [CV](./docs/CV.pdf) here for more about my research projects and background. And please feel free to contact me for any questions or opportunities.
